## Features:
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Parameters** : Easily customize the behavior of the card pile UI using exported parameters, such as card speed, maximum hand size, display and more.
- üìÇ **Simple JSON Loading**: Load card data from a JSON file to populate the card pile.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Intuitive Pile Management**: Manage different card piles, including draw, hand, discard.
- üéâ **Fun UI Elements**: Card interaction is snappy, responsive, and fun out-of-the box, allowing you to skip the boring setup and get started with your game.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

1. Download latest release
2. Unpack the addons/simple_card_pile_ui folder into your /addons folder within the Godot project
3. Enable this addon within the Godot settings: Project > Project Settings > Plugins

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

1. Create a custom resource script extending `CardUIData` that describes any custom properties your card will need. You can utlize inheritance here as needed.
2. Create a database of your card information ([more info](#card-database))([example](#json-database)).
3. Create a collection of your cards ([more info](#card-collection))([example](#json-collection)).
4. Create a new scene with root type `CardUI` - this is the object that displays in game. This object must have 2 TextureRect as children named `Frontface` and `Backface`. It will warn you if configured incorrectly.
5. Add a `CardPileUI` node to your game scene and configure its settings.
6. Begin building your game with the provided methods and signals.

## Concepts
**Card Pile UI** - this is the manager for all cards in a collection.

**Card UI Data** - this represents any custom data that your cards use.

**Card Database** - container for all possible cards, represented by their `CardUIData`

**Card Collection** - container for all cards currently in the game, ie. the deck. Can contain duplicates if the same card is present in the deck multiple times.

**Card UI** - this is the in-game representation of your card data, this holds and displays **Card UI Data**

**Card Dropzone** - this is a designated space where if a player drops a card something occurs. It can also stack cards, removing them from the standard draw/hand/discard piles.

**Draw Pile** - this is a pile containing cards that a player draws from during the game.

**Hand Pile** - this is a pile containing cards currently held by a player.
1
**Discard Pile** - this is a pile containing cards that have been discarded during the game.

**Card Removal from Game**, this occurs when a card is permanently removed from play

<a name="card-ui-data"></a>
### `CardUIData`
`CardUIData` is a resource representing the information to display and
use a single card. It can be subclassed as necessary to store more
information relevant to your game, but at the minimum, it needs the
following information stored in its properties:

* `frontface_texture` - `Texture2D` which will be used by `CardUI` to present the obverse (front) of the card
* `backface_texture` - `Texture2D` which will be used by `CardUI` to present the reverse (back) of the card
* `nice_name` - Human-readable name for the card. Stock `CardUI` does
  not show it by default, but the UI scene provided to `CardPileUI`
  can make use of it (see `example/`)

<a name="card-database"></a>
### Card Database
`CardDB` serves as the foundation for all card data in your game. It
is a `Resource` responsible for loading the `CardUIData` for all cards
that `CardPileUI` will use, and is the abstract base for all
implementations which actually do the loading and retrieval.

Any `CardDB` implementation needs to provide two methods:

* `prepare()` - will be called at least once, before `CardPileUI`
  makes any calls to `get_card()`. This allows the implementation to
  perform any loading and/or processing that it might need to do
* `get_card(card_id) -> CardUIData` - this will be called whenever
  `CardPileUI` needs to access per-card data, and should return an
  instance of `CardUIData` (or its subclass). `card_id` is an opaque
  key that this database can understand. It can be anything the
  implementation wishes to use. Since the key data are provided by the
  caller code, `CardPileUI` does not know or care what they are. The
  only restriction is that the `CardCollection` used (see below) must
  contain keys the `CardDB` being used will understand

There are two built-in implementations of `CardDB`:
* `NullCardDB` - this implementation simply returns any `card_id` it
  receives as-is and performs no loading or retrieval at all. This is
  very useful if you already have a card storage system (for example,
  as custom resources), and simply want to integrate `CardPileUI` into
  your code
* `JSONFileCardDB` - this is a database which loads its data from a
  JSON file and uses strings representing card names as `card_id`

**NOTE**: Earlier versions of `CardPileUI` had hardcoded loading of
JSON files for the card database and collection. If you wish to
continue using JSON files, it is recommended to migrate to
`JSONFileCardDB` and `JSONFileCardCollection`. For backwards
compatibility, if your code does not provide a database/collection and
uses the deprecated JSON path properties, the JSON implementation will
automatically be used as a fallback.

<a name="json-database"></a>
#### `JSONFileCardDB`

`JSONFileCardDB` loads its card data from a JSON file, specified as a
path. At least the following keys are required as a minimally viable
card database:
```
[
  {
	"nice_name": "My Card",
	"texture_path": "res://path/to/card_front.png",
	"backface_texture_path": "res://path/to/card_back.png",
	"resource_script_path": "res://path/to/card_data.gd"
  }
]
```

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nice_name`             | A unique name for this card                                                                                                                                  |
| `texture_path`          | Filepath to the card's front texture. Will be `load()`ed                                                                                                     |
| `backface_texture_path` | Filepath to the card's back texture. Will be `load()`ed                                                                                                      |
| `resource_script_path`  | Filepath to the card's resource script. If you don't need any custom functionality, you can point this to `res://addons/simple_card_pile_ui/card_ui_data.gd` |
| *                       | You can add more data as needed                                                                                                                              |


<a name="card-collection"></a>
### `CardCollection`
This represents the cards that begin in the draw pile (ie. the
deck). Like `CardDB`, `CardCollection` is an abstract base class with
a number of possible implementations. It only needs to provide one
method:

* `_get_all()` - getter for the `all` property, this should return a
  list of all the cards in the deck, represented by their IDs
  (ie. values which can be passed to `CardDB.get_card()`). For that
  reason, the `CardCollection` being used needs to be compatible with
  the `CardDB` in use

There are two built-in implementations provided out of the box:

* `JSONFileCardCollection` - loads and returns array of strings from
  the provided JSON file path. Compatible with `JSONFileCardDB`
* `NullCardCollection` - simply returns whatever was provided as its
  `cards` property. Compatible with `NullCardDB`

<a name="json-collection"></a>
#### `JSONFileCardCollection`

This implementation stores a list of strings which should correspond
to the `nice_name`s of cards in the database. Example:
```
 [ "My Card", "My Card", "My Other Card", "My Other Card" ]
```

## To Do List
- Add support for multiple hands to use the same card pile
- Add more shuffle methods
- Add more sort methods
- Document new properties/methods into the read me
- Add different icons for dropzones/debugger
- Add different layout options for dropzones
